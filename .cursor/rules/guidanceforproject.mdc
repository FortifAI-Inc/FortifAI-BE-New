Here are the global instructions for conduct in this project
- my AWS account ID is 715841361707
- my region is eu-north-1
- there are 3 layers in my backend:
  - api-gateway (namespace api-gateway)
  - microservices (namespace microservices)
  - data-layer (namespace data-layer)
external scripts should only interact with the api-gateway on its public IP address. try avoiding using port forwarding, ask me if you really have to.
the git repositories also follow the same structure, but there's also a forth repo for infrastructure
Even though you are running on macos, the target deployment is AWS, so always build dockers only for X86 / AMD targets !
Whenever rebuilding and redeploying dockers - be sure to delete all relevant old pods in the namespace to ensure they pick up the correct image
always use ECR as registry, dont try a local registry
don't create new namespaces without asking me first.
don't create new ECR repositories without asking me first.
